# Technical Analysis & Action Plan

Hello,

Thanks for sharing the environment dump and additional details. Based on the information provided, here's a breakdown of the likely issues and suggested actions:

---

## Identified Issues

### 1. `502 Bad Gateway` Error

This typically occurs when the RabbitMQ management plugin is either:

- Not enabled or not fully initialized within the container
- Blocked by a reverse proxy (if used)
- Starved of resources (high CPU load or memory pressure), causing management API timeouts

**Action Points:**

- Run `docker exec -it rabbitmq rabbitmq-plugins list`  
  Confirm that `rabbitmq_management` is listed as `[E*]` (enabled).
- Run `docker logs rabbitmq` to check for crash or plugin errors.
- Monitor system load via `docker stats` or `htop` to ensure the instance is not under CPU or memory pressure.

### 2. Only One Queue is Processing Messages

This suggests that either:

- Other queues are not being consumed by any client (no active consumer connections), or
- There’s a failure in the client logic for subscribing to those queues.

**Action Points:**

- Use the RabbitMQ UI (or `rabbitmqctl list_queues name consumers messages_ready messages_unacknowledged`) to inspect each queue’s consumer status.
- Ensure the application actually connects to and consumes from **all** intended queues in the new environment.

---

### 3. Configuration Differences

You mentioned the configuration hasn’t changed, but the environment dump shows **a much more advanced set of RabbitMQ settings** in your previous environment.

These include parameters like:

- `default_consumer_prefetch`
- `dead_letter_worker_consumer_prefetch`
- `channel_tick_interval`
- `msg_store_credit_disc_bound`
- `channel_operation_timeout`

These parameters directly impact queue performance and message handling behavior under load.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Replicate the advanced configuration** from the previous working setup into a `.conf` file in your new environment.
2. We will help you transform the legacy environment settings into modern `rabbitmq.conf` format so they can be reliably used in Docker.
3. Ensure `rabbitmq_management` is properly enabled and healthcheck is passing.
4. Validate that the application reconnects and consumes from all queues.

---

Once we align the runtime behavior with your previous system, we expect stability to return across all queues.

Best regards,  
Veysi
